# selenium

The idea at this project is to write a more clean code, that I have already used during my thesis. Then I tried to make it more functional by using *OOP* and *Page Object Model*. The user can give as an input the number of repetitions and also the server that he wants to test. 

The next steps when I have free time:

- Make a GUI 
- Cross browser test
- Remote test
- Run the selenium on Jenkins
- Code optimization
- Saveing the result of all the test in a new database that I cannot work with that, for learning purpose
