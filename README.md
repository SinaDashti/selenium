# selenium

The idea of this project is to write a more clean code, that I have already used during my thesis. Then I tried to make it better by using *OOP* and *Page Object Model*. The user can give as an input, the number of repetitions and also the server for the test. 


## Usage

`python  main.py Number_of_Repetitions "Location Server"`

Example:

`python main.py 2 "Turin BBBell"`

The next steps when I have free time:

- Make a more persistent version by adding some try/except blocks to the code.
- Make a GUI 
- Cross browser test
- Remote test
- Run the selenium on Jenkins
- Code optimization
- Saving the result of all the test in a new database that I cannot work with that, for learning purpose
- Writing a good documentation and README file :)
